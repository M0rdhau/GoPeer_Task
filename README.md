# GoPeer Internship - URL Shortener

This is my entry for GoPeer Internship challenge built on MERN stack and Formidable labs Victory as data visualization tool

App usage in documented in their own respective directories:
* [Backend](./back/Backend.md)

## Frontend:

To launch the project, as always:

`npm install` and `npm start`

after signing up and logging in, pressing `populate` will, you guessed it, populate the database

## What's different from main branch?

* better code organization on the frontend
* backend tests (which are all passing) with better coverage
* (coming soon) tests on frontend
* (coming soon) live demo
* (coming soon) CD/CI
