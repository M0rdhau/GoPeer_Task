# GoPeer Internship - URL Shortener

This is my entry for GoPeer Internship challenge built on MERN stack and Formidable labs Victory as data visualization tool

App usage in documented in their own respective directories:
* [Backend](./back/Backend.md)

## Frontend:

To launch the project, as always:

`npm install` and `npm start`

after signing up and logging in, pressing `populate` will, you guessed it, populate the database

### Some considerations:
* Even though data is being visualized, I couldn't in time figure out how to sort the graph according to time (now I do, but it's kinda late)
* Frontend has no tests - but it had a lot of potentail to have been tested with different technologies including Cypress
* CSS could have been prettier
